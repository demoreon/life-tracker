## 🤔 Why Life Tracker?

Most habit trackers are either:
- 💸 **Paid apps** with subscriptions you don't need
- 📊 **Spreadsheets** that are clunky and overwhelming
- 🔒 **Cloud apps** that own your personal data
- 🧩 **Over-engineered** with features you'll never use

**Life Tracker is different.**

It's a single folder of files you own. It runs in your browser. Your data never leaves your device. And it looks beautiful doing it.
